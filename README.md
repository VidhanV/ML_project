# ML_project
This project describes the approach which was used to create a program which uses Applied Machine Learning algorithm to automate the mechanical design process of satellites
The code begins by importing all the necessary libraries required for proper functioning of the code, and installing the libraries which were not present. 
Furhermore the dataset which consists of the parameters derived from ANSYS simulations is loaded using pandas method and then a plot which helps us understand a visual
representation of the data parameters distribution is generated.
