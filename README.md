# ML_project
This project describes the approach which was used to create a program which uses Applied Machine Learning algorithm to automate the mechanical design process of satellites
The code uses eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) as the required algorithm to generate the final output in terms of binary result for individual parameter.
