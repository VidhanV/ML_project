# ML_project
This project describes the approach which was used to create a program which uses Applied Machine Learning algorithm to automate the mechanical design process of satellites
The code uses eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) as the required algorithm to generate the final output in terms of binary result for individual parameter.  

In order to ensure proper execution of the tool the libraries mentioned in the file are necessary to be imported, all such necessary libraries are mentioned in the first block of the code. 
Another part of the code which has to be taken into account is the naming of parameters in the users' respective dataset. This name may vary and so should the text be changed for the code which generates the plot to give an overview of data distribution. 

Another important aspect of the code is to make sure that the dataset is divided into training and test dataset, this would require the user to change the numerical value of test dataset based on their preference.
